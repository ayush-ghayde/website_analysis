I will write a project description following your requested sections using the context of the file contents you provided, which is a website analysis project using Python with data visualization. I will create a suitable project title, short description, tech stack, data source description, and features/highlights of the project based on the code and analysis it does.



1. Project Title / Headline  
ðŸ“Š Website Traffic and Engagement Analysis Dashboard  
A comprehensive Python-based analytical dashboard for visualizing and understanding website traffic, user engagement, and channel performance over time.

2. Short Description / Purpose  
This project provides insightful visualizations and analysis of website user sessions, engagement patterns, and traffic distribution by channel and hour. It aims to help web analysts and marketers understand user behavior and optimize digital strategies effectively.

3. Tech Stack  
The project uses the following key technologies:  
â€¢ Python â€“ Main programming language for data analysis.  
â€¢ Pandas â€“ Data manipulation and preprocessing.  
â€¢ Matplotlib & Seaborn â€“ Libraries used for generating visualizations and plots.  
â€¢ Jupyter Notebook â€“ Interactive development environment for exploratory data analysis.

4. Data Source  
The data is sourced from a CSV file named 'data-export (1).csv', containing website analytics data with key metrics like sessions, users, engaged sessions, engagement time, event counts, and channel group info indexed by date and hour.

5. Features / Highlights  
â€¢ Data Cleaning & Transformation: Converting raw CSV data into usable formats, including proper datetime parsing and numeric conversions.  
â€¢ Time Series Analysis: Visualization of total sessions and users over time to identify traffic trends.  
â€¢ Channel Performance: Bar plots showing total users and average engagement time segmented by marketing channel groups.  
â€¢ Engagement Analysis: Boxplots and comparative bar charts to analyze engagement rates and the ratio of engaged vs. non-engaged sessions per channel.  
â€¢ Traffic Patterns: Heatmap display based on hour of day and channel group demonstrating traffic volume distribution.  
â€¢ Business Impact: Helps digital marketers and website owners identify high-performing channels, peak traffic times, and engagement drivers for optimizing marketing spend and website content strategy.
